### Hi there 👋

I'm Tuan, a full-stack developer from Toronto, Canada. Currently unemployed, and spending my time digging into functional programming (Gleam!), infrastructure (my home server + DigitalOcean VPS), and writing webapps and tools.

#### Here are some facts about me:
- 🌱 I have 5 accounts in Oldschool Runescape (A 2000 total level main, a dolo account, a GIM, a F2P HCIM, and a UIM, 4800 hours combined)
- 🍵 I'm a green tea and coffee enjoyer
- 🏆 Isoxo's biggest fan (Top 0.05% Spotify listener in 2023, 2024)
- 🎶 No longer Giveon's biggest fan (Top 0.1% Spotify listener in 2020, 2021, 2022)
