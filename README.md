### Hi there 👋

I'm Tuan, a full-stack developer from Toronto, Canada. Currently unemployed, and spending my time digging into internal development platform (IDP) development, software infrastructure + tools, and high availability software systems.

#### Here are some facts about me:

- 🍵 I'm a green tea and coffee enjoyer
- 🏆 Isoxo's biggest fan (Top 0.05% Spotify listener in 2023, 2024)
- 🎶 No longer Giveon's biggest fan (Top 0.1% Spotify listener in 2020, 2021, 2022)
