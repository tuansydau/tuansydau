### Hi there 👋

I'm Tuan, a software engineering student with a passion for blockchain and backend development.

I started coding in grade school with Roblox Studio where I learned my first programming language, Lua. Then I moved to Unity/C#, and then to backend/blockchain! I've always loved coding as a way to help others, while exercising my creativity in the code that I write. I continue to love coding to this day, and I'm always looking for new ways to make my programs a tad bit craftier.

#### Here are some facts about me:
- 🔭 I’m currently working at [CertiK](https://www.certik.com/) as a Software Engineering Intern, where I help the internal tools team.
- 🌱 I’m working towards becoming a better backend developer, and escaping Gold ELO in Valorant.
- 🎮 I just bought a switch last weekend (Black Friday 2021) and now I can't get off of Animal Crossing.
- 🎸 A (rusty) guitarist and bassist, mainly focused on Jazz and R&B.
- 🏎️ Incoming Software Engineering Intern at Tesla!

#### Feel free to reach out on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/tuansydau/), I'm always happy to talk!
